# TTF2BMP

A .NET Library and Tool for converting .ttf to .bmp for Localized Font Textures in MonoGame (3.8.3+).  

If you want sprite font textures which only contain the characters used in your localized text,  
this is especially for small pixel fonts that might need manual editing of the texture. 

# How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.

2.  Build TTF2BMP and TTF2BMP.Content.

3.  Click "Choose Text Files" and choose whatever files you are using to store your text or "Export Default (32 .. 126) for fast creation.

4.  Click Export.  It will ask you where to save the output bitmap... BUT it is also saving a .txt file of the same name that lists all the unique characters in your game's text.  You need to keep this text file around (add to perforce, etc.) so that the content importer/processor can match up the glyphs to the characters.

5.  Go ahead and edit the texture, just donâ€™t move any of the glyphs out of order.  Chances are some characters still rendered wonkily, but now you can fix them in photoshop.

6.  Open up the MonoGame Pipeline Tool and your content.mgcb file.  Select the root node, and at the bottom, add a reference to the TTF2BMP.Content.dll you built earlier.

7.  Now Add the bitmap you just made to the project.

8.  Under Importer, choose "Localized Font - Importer", and under Processor choose "Localized Font - Processor".  Set the 'FirstCharacter' field to 0; it remains since we subclassed the default Font Importer, but the default value of 'space' gets serialized to an empty string, which causes MGCB to believe it "NeedsRebuild", unless you change it.

9.  Build your content and you should be done with this part.

10.  To use the font in game, it works exactly like any other sprite font; just do contentManager.Load<SpriteFont>(fontName) and it should work as usual.
